# LinkedSignal

### Dependent state with linkedSignal

The `linkedSignal` function lets you create a signal to hold some state that is intrinsically linked to some other state. Revisiting the example above, `linkedSignal` can replace signal

```typescript

@Component({/* ... */})
export class ShippingMethodPicker {
  shippingOptions: Signal<ShippingMethod[]> = getShippingOptions();

  // Initialize selectedOption to the first shipping option.
  selectedOption = linkedSignal(() => this.shippingOptions()[0]);

  changeShipping(index: number) {
    this.selectedOption.set(this.shippingOptions()[index]);
  }

}

```

In the exemple above, we could use :
```typescript
signal(this.shippingOptions()[0])
``` 
but we could be stucked if selectedOption changes and may contain a value that is no longer a valid option.
That's the reason why `linkedSignal` is the better alternative.

#

`linkedSignal` works similarly to signal with one key differenceâ€” instead of passing a default value, you pass a computation function, just like computed. When the value of the computation changes, the value of the `linkedSignal` changes to the computation result. This helps ensure that the `linkedSignal` always has a valid value.

#
## Accounting for previous state

In some cases, the computation for a `linkedSignal` needs to account for the previous value of the `linkedSignal`.

In the example above, `selectedOption` always updates back to the first option when `shippingOptions` changes. You may, however, want to preserve the user's selection if their selected option is still somewhere in the list. To accomplish this, you can create a `linkedSignal` with a separate _source_ and _computation_:

```typescript

@Component({/* ... */})
export class ShippingMethodPicker {

  shippingOptions = signal<ShippingMethod[]>([
    { id: 0, name: 'Ground' },
    { id: 1, name: 'Air' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Sea' },
  ]);

  selectedOption = linkedSignal<ShippingMethod[], ShippingMethod>({
    // `selectedOption` is set to the `computation` result whenever this `source` changes.
    source: this.shippingOptions,
    computation: (newOptions, previous) => {
      // If the newOptions contain the previously selected option, preserve that selection.
      // Otherwise, default to the first option.
      return (
        newOptions.find((opt) => opt.id === previous?.value.id) ?? newOptions[0]
      );
    },
  });

}
```

#
### Custom equality comparison

`linkedSignal`, as any other signal, can be configured with a custom equality function. This function is used by downstream dependencies to determine if that value of the `linkedSignal` (result of a computation) changed:

```typescript
const activeUser = signal({id: 123, name: 'Morgan', isAdmin: true});

const activeUserEditCopy = linkedSignal(() => activeUser(), {
  // Consider the user as the same if it's the same `id`.
  equal: (a, b) => a.id === b.id,
});

// Or, if separating `source` and `computation`
const activeUserEditCopy = linkedSignal({
  source: activeUser,
  computation: user => user,
  equal: (a, b) => a.id === b.id,
});
```
